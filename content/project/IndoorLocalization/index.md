title:  Indoor Localization with 3D Facility Scan Data
summary: Visual indoor localization for smart indoor services is a growing field of interest as cameras are now ubiquitously equipped on smart phones. In this study, a hierarchical indoor localization algorithm is designed and validated based on 3D facility scan data. The study has shown promising results in indoor localization. As more facilities are documented with laser scanners, our Algorithm can unlock additional values of collected data for intelligent applications.
