title:  Indoor Localization with 3D Facility Scan Data
summary: Visual indoor localization for smart indoor services is a growing field of interest as
cameras are now ubiquitously equipped on smart phones. In this study, a hierarchi-
cal indoor localization algorithm is designed and validated based on 3D facility scan
data, which are originally collected for facility modeling purposes. The study has
shown promising results in indoor localization. The study also demonstrated a scal-
able approach to generate high-quality images with reference poses from laser scan
data, opening doors to generate labelled images to train end-to-end pose regression
model (i.e., PoseNet). In this regard, this study is the first attempt to leverage facility
scan data, which are commonly collected for BIM purpose, for indoor localization.
As more facilities are documented with laser scanners, our Algorithm can unlock
additional values of collected data for intelligent applications.
