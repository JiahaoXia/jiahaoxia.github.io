title:  Computer Vision based Near Miss Detection among Mixed Traffic Flows within Intersections

summary: Intersection safety stands as a paramount concern within the realm of transportation and urban planning. In this study, we propose a computer vision-based framework designed to estimate the 3D positions of vehicles and pedestrians from traffic videos. Notably, our approach does not necessitate the availability of ground truth 3D bounding boxes for training purposes. The derived 3D information enables the calculation of traffic flow velocities and directions, thus empowering us to identify potential near-miss incidents among road users.
