title:  Computer Vision based First Floor Elevation Estimation from Mobile LiDAR Data
summary: First Floor Elevation (FFE) of a house is crucial information for flood management and for accurately assessing the flood exposure risk of a property. However, the lack of reliable FFE data on a large geographic scale significantly limits efforts to mitigate flood risk, such as decision on elevating a property. In this paper, we propose an automated and scalable method for extracting FFE from mobile LiDAR point cloud data.
